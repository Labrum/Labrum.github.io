An antidote to chaos. Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life as given in his book:

1. Stand up straight with your shoulders back
2. Treat yourself like someone you are responsible for helping
3. Make friends with people who want the best for you
4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
7. Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
8. Tell the truth – or, at least, don't lie
9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't
10. Be precise in your speech
11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding
12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street

These 12 rules are aimed at mitigating the dangerous affects of chaos. Promoting the kind of order needed to live a productive and meaningful life.

Peterson presents facing the hardships of life as heroic. Life is not easy or a constant delight, nor should it be. Instead if we turn to face what is hard we will find we are stronger (or can become stronger) than we could have imagined. That each person should endeavour to set the world right, but begin with themselves.

Accepting hardships not only as part of life, but as essential to giving life meaning. Start small and give yourself credit for your improvements. Delaying gratifications, considering the plight of others. Be suspicious of your true intentions. Don't lie. And ofcourse, most importantly __clean your room!__
